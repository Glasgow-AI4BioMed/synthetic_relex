# synthetic_relex dataset for biomedical relation extraction

This is a relation extraction dataset containing synthetic labels created with Llama 3.3 70B when prompted with sentences from [PubTator Central](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/research/pubtator3/). It has been used to train a BERT-based relation classifier, enabling the distillation of a larger Llama model to a BERT model.

**Note:** No humans were involved in annotating this dataset, so there may be erroneous annotations. Detailed evaluation by human experts would be needed to gain an accurate view of the dataset's accuracy. This model offers a starting point for understanding and development of biomedical relation extraction models.
